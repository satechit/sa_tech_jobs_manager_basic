	<h1 class="atitle">1. After Installation</h1>
	<div class="acontent">
		<p>
			Thank you for installing our Plugin. After the installation, the first step would be to go to the plugin settings page and fill in the following details as needed.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Job Form Page:</b> Choose the page from the drop-down menu where youâ€™d like the candidates to see the complete details of the job theyâ€™ve chosen to apply at. The Job Application Form will also appear on this page so the candidates can apply for the job after reading the complete details. Donâ€™t add any content to this page because any extra content youâ€™d add to this page wonâ€™t appear on the front-end. Visitors on the front-end site will only see the Job Application Form, and the Job Ad details they have clicked at.</li>
			<li><b>Company name:</b> Enter the name of your company here. Use the code {company_name} in email templates, and the plugin will fetch the name of your company in your email message automatically.</li>
			<li><b>From name and email address:</b> The name and email address that you would like the applicants to see when they receive an email from you.</li>
			<li><b>Email Address:</b> If youâ€™d like to receive the job applications via email, then please enter a valid email address in the email address text box on the settings page. Youâ€™ll receive an email on your registered email address from the system as soon as someone applies for a job. If you leave this box empty or enter an invalid email address but have attached an email template with the event "Email to admin on new job application" in email templates, then the system will start sending the job applications at the Administrator's email address. See option 5 for details regarding email templates.</li>
			<li><b>Deleting Job Applications Automatically:</b> Our plugin is GDPR compliant, and if youâ€™d like the job applications to be automatically deleted, then please select the number of days from the drop-down menu on the settings page after which youâ€™d like the application to be deleted. You can choose between 10-500 days. If you don't want the applications to be deleted, then choose the never option.</li>
			<li><b>Currency:</b> If you plan to mention salary or hourly rate on the job ad, then please select your default currency.</li>
			<li>
				<b>Setting up HR role:</b>
				A new role "<b>SA Job (HR)</b>" will be available for you when you are adding or modifying a user on your site. Users whom you have assigned the HR role will have access to all functionalities of our plugin, but they won't be able to access anything else on your site.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<h1 class="atitle">2. Setting up Job Listings Page</h1>
	<div class="acontent">
		<p>
			We have two different page layouts/designs. You can use the one which suits your needs better. Paste one of the following shortcodes on any page where you want to advertise your jobs/show your job listings/openings.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For design 1 use <code>[sa_jobs_list_design1]</code></li>
			<li>For design 2 use <code>[sa_jobs_list_design2]</code></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For example, you want to show your job ads on the home page, open all pages and click on the home page. When the home page opens, paste one of the above-mentioned shortcodes there and click update. You are done, wasnâ€™t that easy? Your job ads will now start appearing on your home page.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do not like the first layout, you may paste the other shortcode on the page where you want to advertise your jobs and click update. Now you are using the second design ðŸ˜Š
		</p>
	</div>

	<h1 class="atitle">3. Advertising Jobs on Multiple Pages</h1>
	<div class="acontent">
		<p>
			You can also advertise your jobs on multiple pages. Paste the shortcodes on multiple pages, and the job ads added by you that are active will start appearing on multiple pages.
		</p>
		<p>
			But to advertise jobs, youâ€™d first need to add some job ads to the system. Follow the guideline below to learn how to add a new job opening.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h1 class="atitle">4. Adding/Posting Job Ads</h1>
	<div class="acontent">

					<u><i>CC & BCC email address:</i></u> use these functions only if you want your colleague, client, or anyone else to receive an email when someone applies for this job, a copy of the email that is sent to the admin will be sent at these mail addresses<br>
					<u><i>Job location:</i></u> write the location of the job here<br>
					<u><i>External link:</i></u> if you want to redirect the applicant to a different page upon clicking the apply button, then add that URL over here. This is very helpful for recruitment agencies, as they want the applicants to not apply for the job on their website but at a different site. If no URL is added here, then the applicant will see the normal job form.<br>
					<u><i>Job type:</i></u> select the job type from the drop-down menu if youâ€™d like.<br>
					<u><i>Salary and salary type:</i></u> enter the salary amount, and the type of salary (only if you wish to mention it on the front-end, and want your applicants to see it).<br>
